Summary of Errors Fixed in ViTAdapter
1. Position Embedding Shape Mismatch (Critical)
Problem: The _get_pos_embed method was using hardcoded pretrained dimensions (37x37 from 518÷14) instead of actual input dimensions (36x72 from 504÷14 and 1008÷14)
Error: shape '[1, 37, 37, -1]' is invalid for input of size 196608
Fix: Modified _get_pos_embed to use actual H_vit and W_vit parameters instead of self.pretrain_size


2. DWConv Spatial Dimension Handling
Problem: DWConv in adapter modules assumed square inputs and used hardcoded kernel sizes
Fix: Made DWConv robust to handle arbitrary input shapes by calculating appropriate kernel sizes dynamically

3. Feature Fusion Spatial Mismatches
Problem: ViT features and adapter features had different spatial dimensions, causing addition failures
Fix: Added interpolation in feature fusion to ensure all features have matching spatial dimensions before addition


4. Deformable Attention Reference Points
Problem: deform_inputs function had hardcoded spatial assumptions that didn't work with rectangular images
Fix: Updated to use actual spatial dimensions from input tensors

5. Token Factorization Logic
Problem: Converting token sequences back to 2D spatial features needed robust factorization for non-square dimensions
Fix: Implemented _factorize_tokens method to find optimal H×W factorization preserving aspect ratios

6. Pretrained Weight Loading
Problem: Position embeddings from pretrained weights (square) didn't match model requirements (rectangular)
Fix: Added interpolation logic in weight loading to resize position embeddings appropriately

7. SPM Integration Issues
Problem: Spatial Pyramid Module outputs needed proper integration with ViT token sequences
Fix: Ensured consistent token sequence handling and spatial dimension tracking
